# [Project 2 : TV Script Generation using Long Short Term Memory model : Project Overview](https://github.com/harshitw/TV-SCRIPT-GENERATION)
* Generation of tv scripts using LSTM's of simpsons tv show.
* Based on the entire TV Script of the Simpson TV show that lasted for years, this model takes that data and models it into new script generator.
